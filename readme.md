### Cloudflare Workers Deployment

We attempted to deploy this Mastra application to Cloudflare Workers using the following commands (after login):

```bash
npm run build && wrangler deploy --config .mastra/output/wrangler.json
```

**Status**: The build process completes successfully without errors, but Mastra does not automatically generate the required `wrangler.json` configuration file for Cloudflare Workers deployment.

**Issue**: Manual configuration of Cloudflare Workers deployment is required as the automatic generation is not implemented in the current Mastra version.
